  Prepared Queries 
  Prepare relevant queries for your populated database. Create an SQL file named 
  “prepared_queries.sql”. 
  This file should contain at least 3 queries that meet the following requirements: 
  # Each query is in a stored procedure or user-defined function format. 
  # Each query performs a meaningful action based on the case study. 
  # Each query includes a comment that describes the purpose of the query. 
  # Each query has a separate SQL statement that tests the query.
